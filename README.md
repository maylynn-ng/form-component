#### Observations :male_detective:

- State management. While in a larger project I would opt to use Redux or React context, for an app of this size I didn't feel it necessary, and (even though I haven't seen the entire app) I would normally not save form data into a Redux store.

##### If I had more time 🧨

- Possibly implement routing to make logo link back to userForm page 
- Add more animations: between pages, shake if user clicks on disabled button, etc.
- Create this as more of a template so that it could be reused throughout the app
